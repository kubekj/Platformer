# Yuiop Platform - Comprehensive Architecture Documentation

## 1. Strategic Architecture Overview

The Yuiop platform implements a distributed architecture optimized for experience creation, management, and delivery. Our design philosophy centers on:

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear boundaries between experience management, user interactions, and analytics capabilities
- **Event-Driven Core**: Asynchronous communication patterns enabling system resilience and horizontal scaling
- **Edge-First Architecture**: Strategic edge deployment optimizing user experience and content delivery
- **Observability by Design**: Comprehensive monitoring and diagnostics integrated at every layer

## 2. System Components

### 2.1 Frontend Architecture (Nuxt 3)

The frontend layer leverages Nuxt 3's capabilities for optimal server-side rendering and state management and will be responsible for:

- Experience creation and management interface
- Real-time preview and editing capabilities
- Analytics dashboard presentation
- Client-side state orchestration


### 2.2 Backend Services

#### Experience Service (.NET 8)
Manages the core experience lifecycle with responsibilities including:
- Experience CRUD operations
- SaaS Middleware
- Access control and sharing mechanics
- Content validation and enrichment

#### Analytics Service (Python/FastAPI)
Handles metrics and insights with focus on:
- Real-time analytics processing
- Historical data analysis
- Metric aggregation and reporting
- Trend identification

## 3. Data Architecture

### 3.1 Database Strategy

### 3.2 Caching Strategy

Multi-level caching approach optimized for different access patterns:

1. **Edge Cache (CDN)**
   - Static assets and published content
   - TTL: 1 hour
   - Automatic purging on content updates

2. **Application Cache (Redis)**
   - Session data and real-time analytics
   - TTL: 5 minutes
   - Write-through caching pattern

3. **Database Cache (PostgreSQL)**
   - Query results and materialized views
   - Refresh: Every 10 minutes
   - Async refresh mechanism

## 4. Event-Driven Architecture

- **Core Event Types**: Experience lifecycle events (creation, modification, publication)
- **Domain Events**: User activities, partner integrations, system alerts
- **Event Processing**: Centralized event bus with dedicated handlers for analytics, notifications, and audit logging
- **Event Patterns**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) with event sourcing for experience changes

## 5. Security Architecture

- **Zero Trust Model**: All requests authenticated and authorized regardless of origin
- **Security Layers**: Authentication, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), encryption, and comprehensive audit logging
- **Data Protection**: At-rest and in-transit encryption with key rotation
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions based on identity and context

## 6. Deployment Architecture

- **Edge First**: CDN deployment for static assets and experience content
- **High Availability**: Load-balanced application cluster with auto-scaling
- **Data Layer**: Primary-replica database configuration with Redis caching
- **Worker Processing**: Dedicated nodes for background tasks and event processing

## 7. Monitoring and Observability

- **Metrics Collection**: Performance, business, and system health indicators
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging with structured data
- **Distributed Tracing**: Request tracking across service boundaries
- **Alerting**: Automated incident detection and response
